  					<p>Tired of being always late for your lessons? Nevermind! NeverLate has the right solution for you. NeverLate is a simple and versatile wrist-watch that notifies if you are late, so that you’ll never miss a lecture!</p>
  					<p>Its primary function is to notify you as soon as possible when you have to head out to the classroom. There are plenty of situations in which NeverLate can help you: for example during breaks, if you are in an endless queue waiting for the bathroom or the vending machine, NeverLate will let you know exactly when you have to give up. And why not letting NeverLate manage your inter-lessons free time? If you want to have a reinvigorating lunch, or find a quiet place to study, don’t worry and take your time! Do not stress yourself anymore by always keeping an eye on your watch and your timetable: NeverLate will take care of all this for you.</p>
  				</div>
  				<div class="col-md-6">
  					<p>This is achieved in a number of ways:<br>
  					<ul>
  						<li>NeverLate knows your schedule: it is fully aware of when and where your next lecture is planned.</li>
  						<li>NeverLate knows how much time is needed to get to the classroom in relation to your current position in the campus.</li>
  						<li>NeverLate gives the possibility to the professor to send quick notifications or messages to his students .This feature can be used by the professor to give real time updates, for example to inform the students to finish the break or that the lecture schedule has changed.</li>
  						
  					</ul>
  					</p>
  					<p>The notification system is fully customizable to take into account your preferences: if you like to be always five minutes early, you can just tell NeverLate and it will adapt to best fit your needs. Moreover, if you want to plan something and you need to know how much time you have left before leaving, just tap the screen and NeverLate will answer to you!</p>

			<p class="text-center">We also plan to expand the service outside the campus! Everywhere you’ll go, Neverlate will always be with you!</p>
