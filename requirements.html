											<strong>Priority 1</strong>
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>2.</strong>
											“Tap” function<br>

											<strong>4.</strong>
											“Do not disturb” mode<br>

											<strong>Priority 2</strong>
										</li>
										<li>

											Schedule update notification<br>

									Localization accuracy<br>
									The system must be able to recognize the proximity of the user to a specific area of the campus. Areas of the campus must be dimensioned so that the time to cross them is less than 1 minute walk. The maximum acceptable positioning error is that the user is localized in an area adjacent to the one the the user is in. The system should avoid to erroneously localize a student in a wrong floor.

									Localization attempts frequency<br>
									Unless the function is not directly called by the user or by a professor ping (see FR 2.2 or FR 4.1), the system will update the position of the user (and so the estimated travel time) every 1 minute starting from 30 minutes before the next lecture.

								<td>Reliability</td>
								<td>
									Localization and time travel estimation malfunctioning<br>
									If the user cannot be localized, or his travel time cannot be estimate, the watch assumes by default 15 minutes time travel for the destination until the system doesn’t start to run properly again.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>12</td>
								<td>Reliability</td>
								<td>
									Network malfunctioning<br>
									If for some reasons there is no internet connection on the user interface, the system will signal it. If there is a local calendar accessible on the device (google calendar app) the system will still send notification using the default value specified in NFR 11.
